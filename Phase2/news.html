           <p>Turkey announced more than <strong> 42,500</strong> new coronavirus cases, including <strong> 1,706 </strong> symptomatic patients, according to the Health Ministry on Monday.             
              A total of 42,551 cases were registered across the country over the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to nearly 3.53 million.
              The nationwide death toll reached 32,456 with 193 more fatalities.            
              As many as 25,627 more patients won the battle against the disease, raising the number of recoveries over 3.13 million.           
              More than 39.81 million coronavirus tests have been conducted in Turkey to date, with 245,496 done since Sunday.</p>

                    In the face of rising case and fatality numbers, Turkey announced the return of weekend lockdowns in high-risk areas, 
                    as well as other restrictions, in addition to special measures for the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

           <p>Nasa has chosen Elon Musk's company SpaceX to build a lander that will return humans to the Moon this decade.
              This vehicle will carry the next man and the first woman down to the lunar surface under the space agency's Artemis programme.              
              Another goal of the programme will be to land the first person of colour on the Moon.              
              The lander is based on SpaceX's Starship craft, which is being tested at a site in southern Texas.
              SpaceX was competing against a joint bid from traditional aerospace giants and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as well as Alabama-based Dynetics. 
              The total value of the contract awarded to Musk's company is $2.89bn.</p>

                 <p class="border p-1 shadow-sm rounded clearfix m-1" >The Artemis programme, initiated under the Trump administration, had targeted a return to the lunar surface in 2024.
                     But a shortfall in funding of the landing system has made that goal unattainable.
                    Elon Musk has been developing the Starship design for years. Resembling the rocketships from the golden age of science fiction, 
                    it is a crucial component of the entrepreneur's long-term plans for settling humans on Mars.</p>

           <img src = "https://teknosafari.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kapat%C4%B1ilan-facebook-hesabi-nasil-acilir-facebook-geri-getirme.jpg" class="home-pages-photos img-fluid mx-auto" width = "200" height = "160" alt = "Picture of News" />
              <p> A rich cache of data on some 533 million Facebook users was posted to a hacker forum over the weekend and is available to download for practically free.
                  The information is from a data breach that occurred in 2019, but hasn't been widely available until now.
                 The data was posted to an English-speaking cybercriminal forum called RaidForums by a hacker going by the handle TomLiner.
                 "The Facebook data was first listed for sale on RaidForums on June 6, 2020, but the initial sale allegedly asked users for
                  US$30,000 in exchange for the data," explained Ivan Righi, 
                 a cyber threat intelligence analyst with Digital Shadows, a San Francisco-based provider of digital risk protection solutions.</p>

                 <p class="border p-1 shadow-sm rounded clearfix m-1" >"TomLiner's post exposed the data for eight forum tokens -- approximately $2.52," 
                    he told TechNewsWorld. "The data has been unlocked by close to 3,800 users, generating TomLiner over $9,500."
                    Michael Isbitski, a technical evangelist with Salt Security, 
                    a Palo Alto, Calif.-based provider of API security, added that at the 
                    time of that incident in 2019, Facebook indicated the data of 220 million users was
                     scraped prior to the company restricting access in the platform to preserve users' privacy.                    
                    "It's plausible that this is partially the old data set resurfaced and
                     combined with other scraped data sets since the number has now ballooned to 533 million users," he told TechNewsWorld.

              <p> In just his second race for Red Bull, Sergio Perez out-qualified team mate Max Verstappen and secured a first front-row start for himself in the process – but the Mexican said he should have 
                 gone one better and taken pole position off Lewis Hamilton on Saturday at Imola.
                 Just 0.035s separated Perez and Hamilton in the fight for pole position on Saturday and while Perez was 
                 understandably elated to take second on the grid for the first time in 193 appearances - his 192 starts without a front-row having been an unwanted record - 
                 he was adamant that pole position should have been his if not for a mistake on his final Q3 flying effort. </p>

                 <p class="border p-1 shadow-sm rounded clearfix m-1"> The former Force India and Racing Point driver did however admit that he did not expect to be so high in the order starting on Sunday, given he and Esteban Ocon collided in free practice on Friday – 
                    which gave his Red Bull squad an uphill task for the following sessions.
                    “First of all I have to say well done to the team,” he began after securing P2. “Yesterday I made a mistake and made 
                    them work hard during the day so it’s a good recovery. The most important thing is that we show progress. I never expected to be here today, 
                    you know [considering] where we were yesterday. We’ve been improving but it’s just important to be P2.”</p>
