# My First Web Site 
It's based on a statement of work and I covered all need-to-know parts on HTML,CSS and Bootstrap with coding this basic but effective web site.

* Phase 1 is made with pure HTML and CSS so it's not responsive at all.
* Phase 2 is the responsive and enhanced version of phase 1 (with using Bootstrap)
* I used Bootstrap version 4.6.0
