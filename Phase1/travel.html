      <h2>Tokyo, Japan</h2><hr>
     <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/a7/b4/75a7b43b6728b39c3f9948870c7773c9.jpg" width = "450"  height = "300" alt="Tokyo-square">
      <p>
         Tokyo (東京), officially the Tokyo Metropolis (東京都), is the de facto capital and most populous prefecture of Japan.It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities,
          towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.
         Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the 16th century, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous cities. 
         With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, 
         which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the <strong> Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945.</strong>
         Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, 
         Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.

         <h2>Big Sky, Montana</h2><hr>  
        <iframe class="videos" width = "450"  height = "300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hLsDN39Bjyw" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         <p>Big Sky’s 5,800 acres of skiable terrain makes it a fan favorite for crowd-free skiing in the Rocky Mountains. 
            But a multi-year, $150 million investment into Big Sky Resort aims to transform this region of Southwest Montana into America’s Alps, 
            meaning skiers may soon have to share their powder-perfect runs. Last year, The Wilson Hotel, a Residence Inn by Marriott, made headlines when it became the 
            first and only major brand hotel to open in Big Sky’s town center (don’t miss the soon-to-open Tips Up, a vintage-inspired tavern across 
            the street). Now, all eyes are on the $400 million ultra-luxury Montage Big Sky, which will open its doors for the 2021-22 ski season within
             Spanish Peaks Mountain Club, a 3,500-acre private golf and ski community. The 150-key resort features ski-in, ski-out access, an 11,000-square-foot spa, and a four-lane bowling alley.
              In warmer climes, guests can enjoy the development’s 18-hole golf course, nearby fly-fishing rivers, and an extensive network of hiking and mountain biking trails. Two slope-side hotels, the Summit and the Huntley Lodge, have renovations in the works, and Moonlight Basin, another private development adjacent to the ski resort, 
              has plans to build a luxury hotel (a One&Only if the rumors are true) on its 8,000-acre-property, which is also home to a thousand-acre high-elevation Jack Nicklaus signature golf course.

      <h2>Pyramids of Giza, Egypt</h2><hr>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/PER/egypt-pyramids-world-heritage.jpg" width = "450"  height = "300"  alt="Pyramids of Giza">  
      <p>One of the most iconic sites in the world, the Pyramids of Giza, just outside Cairo, are a surreal sight rising from the barren desert landscape. Standing guard nearby, and almost as impressive, is the Sphinx, gazing blankly out over the land.
       The pyramids were built as tombs for the Pharaohs, the largest of which was constructed between 2560 and 2540 BC. To put their age in perspective, they were already more than 2,600 years old when the Colosseum in Rome was being built.
       Today, these giant monuments are the sole surviving member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

         <h2>Petra, Jordan</h2><hr>
         <iframe class="videos" width = "450"  height = "300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SZ5JjLdzQ1o" title="YouTube video player"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         <p>A dramatic, narrow rock gorge allows entrance to the ancient city of Petra, a stone city with dwellings hewn into sandstone walls. 
            This ancient capital city of the Nabataeans has roots that trace back to as early as the 4th or 5th century BC. Discovered by the West in the early 1800s, it has been referred to as "the rose city" for the color of the rock, and for obvious reason,
             "the carved city." Situated in a mountainous area with limited access, it held a strategic position on an important trade route in the region.
              Today, Petra is the most important tourist attraction in Jordan.The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, 
              and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain.
